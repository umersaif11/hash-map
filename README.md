# hash-map

An Odin Project Learning about the Hash Map Data Structure

This project implements Hash-Map/Hash-Set using  
modern JavaScript (ES6 modules) and Node v22.  


## Features

The `HashMap` class includes the following  
functions:

- `hash(key)`  
  Takes a key and produces a hash code with it.  

- `set(key, value)`  
  Takes two arguments: the first is a key, and the second is a value that is assigned to this key. If a key already exists, then the old value is overwritten.  

- `resize()`  
  Grow your buckets to double their capacity when your hash map reaches the load factor.  

- `get(key)`  
  Takes one argument as a key and returns the value that is assigned to this key. If a key is not found, return null.  

- `has(key)`  
   Takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map..  

- `remove(key)`  
  Takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the entry with that key and return true. If the key isnâ€™t in the hash map, it should return false.  

- `length()`  
  Returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.  

- `clear()`  
  Removes all entries in the hash map.  

- `keys()`  
  Returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.  

- `values()`  
  Returns an array containing all the values..  

- `entries()`  
  Returns an array that contains each key, value pair. Example: [[firstKey, firstValue], [secondKey, secondValue]].
